- change our name due to LEGO Company request
- improve sensor detection.response times (see: priority patch, dat4 project)
- add assignment of HOSTID for LNP at download time (firmdl3)
- timeout handling needs improvement. if the RCX transmits data, the IR
  tower will shutdown more quickly.
- Fix DJGPP support. Should mainly be a matter of compiling new tools.
- maybe switch loader.c from getopt_long (GNU only) to getopt (POSIX
  compliant) for easier porting.

Many, many ideas from the mailing list, mainly from Eddie & Paolo:
- Redo the tool chain. Eddie has volunteered.
- Redo sensor handling code. Eddie and Paolo will take care of this.
- Implement event queues?
- Implement a timer function?
- Just rewrite battery task as a real task (systimer is oversized)
- Introduce a new Makefile.Config with all Makefiles definitio and
  test for presence of Perl during make process.
- Debug functions via LNP. Paolo already have a prototype.
- Remote control of RCX via LNP. Maybe better in a userspace task.

Wishlist:
- Standardize all platforms on gcc 2.95 for compatibility.
- PHP-based web compiler hosted at sourceforge.
- Finally, the PHP-based documentation commentary system I (Luis) keep
  promising.
