Hello, this is brickOS-0.2.6 plus patches:

This software will run on Linux and Windows (using the Cygwin tool suite.)

To start with brickOS:

- Type make. Utilities, libraries, a default kernel and some demos will
  be made.
- Pre-packaged binaries have been discontinued.
- Be sure to add brickOS-0.2.6/util to your PATH. Set RCXTTY if you use a non-
  standard port for the IR tower. Use firmdl3 to download boot/brickOS.srec
  to your RCX.
- Type "dll demo/helloworld.lx". If all is well, it should be automatically
  relocated and transmitted to program slot 0. Press the RUN key to run. The
  program stops automatically.
- Type "dll -p1 demo/rover.lx" to transmit another demo to program slot 1.
  Use the PRGM key to select the desired program. Try RUN.

- Stop your program with the RUN or ON/OFF key. Programs are preserved over
  ON/OFF now.  Press ON/OFF and PRGM simultaneously to erase brickOS.

If things don't quite work, work at it.

For your own projects,

- Make a directory in the brickOS root directory.
- Copy Makefile from the demo directory.
- Put your main routine into myproject.c. (.C if using C++)
- If you need more source files, add them in the Makefile.
- "make myproject.lx && dll myproject.lx".

In case anyone is wondering, dll is short for dynamic linker and loader.
