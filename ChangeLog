	* Applied Patch #552135: RCX Remote control support + misc
	  fixes: animated figure (doesn't fidget anymore),
	  dll Program numbers now consistent (1 - 8), LCD display
	  of motor dir during braking now correct, cputc_native_xxx macros 
	  now allow expression as arg, and dll now allows delete of program.
	* small adjustments to two demos
	* This effectively removes the prior IR Remote implementation as
	  it is now a blend of the two patched approaches
	* Added new config settings:
	   CONF_RCX_PROTOCOL    // RCX protocol handler (lnp)
	   CONF_LR_HANDLER      // Remote control button event dispatcher
	   CONF_RCX_MESSAGE     // Standard firmare message functions
	  Which replaced the following settings:
	   CONF_REMOTE_CTRL      // remote control
	   CONF_RKEY_HANDLER     // remote control keys handler
	   CONF_RKEY_MOTOR       // remote control motor
	   CONF_MESSAGE          // standard firmware message
